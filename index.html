                        <p class="card-description">Nest-Ease is a property management application that tracks rentals across multiple buildings. The system consists of two main components: a mobile application (built with Flutter) for tenants and a web-based application (built with Next.js) for the back office team. The mobile app provides tenants with an easy-to-use interface to submit maintenance requests, track their rent payments, and manage their lease details. On the other hand, the Next.js web application is used by the back office team to handle tickets, manage buildings, flats, and furniture, and provide reports on rental activities. Next.js allowed for server-side rendering (SSR), improving the performance and SEO of the application, while Flutter enabled rapid development of the mobile app, leveraging a single codebase for both Android and iOS platforms. The backend was built using Node.js and NestJS, enabling a modular architecture for easy scaling and maintenance. The system also integrates with third-party APIs for payment processing and email notifications.</p>

                        <p class="card-description">The e-Signature Capture application was developed using React and the Electron library to create a desktop application capable of capturing signatures over PDF files. This software is designed to facilitate the signing process between back-office staff and clients. The Electron framework allowed us to build a cross-platform application that operates both on Windows and macOS. Using React for the front end provided a dynamic and responsive user interface, where users could interact with the PDF document, place their signature, and save it digitally. The application uses a combination of HTML5 Canvas for capturing the signature and a secure file-saving mechanism that stores the signed PDFs locally or in the cloud. The system enables real-time communication between two devices, allowing the back-office staff to send the document to the client, receive the signature, and save it with a time stamp. The app integrates with REST APIs to manage document versions and ensure secure transmission of signed files.</p>

The project was developed under my leadership within a week by a team of five members. Built using Vue.js, it aimed to showcase the various events and programs happening during the fest. The site was designed for event registration, real-time event updates, and live schedules. We used Vue.js to ensure fast rendering and smooth state management, allowing users to seamlessly interact with event information. Vuex was used for centralized state management, while Vue Router facilitated easy navigation between pages. Additionally, we utilized a simple, responsive design, ensuring that the site was accessible across all devices. The backend was supported by a minimal server setup, enabling event updates and registrations. The project required rapid development and deployment, with the team working in agile sprints to meet tight deadlines.</p>

The website, developed using React, was designed to provide detailed information about the event and facilitate registrations. The application was built with the goal of offering real-time updates, event rules, and a user-friendly registration process. React was chosen for its efficiency in creating dynamic user interfaces and its component-based architecture, allowing for the development of reusable UI elements. We utilized React Router for seamless page navigation and Axios for asynchronous API calls to handle event data and user registration. To manage the state across the application, we leveraged React's Context API, which helped us avoid prop drilling and maintain centralized state management. The site also included a real-time countdown timer to track the event's start time, and Firebase was integrated for authentication and storing registration data securely. The design followed a modern and responsive pattern, ensuring compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
